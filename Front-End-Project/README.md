## Popcorn Watch
### Overview
Popcorn Watch is a React front end app that was created during our front end module by Deja Clarke and I. As a user you can search the top movies and shows and get more information regarding the selected movies. 

It is an app that is meant to attract movie and tv junkies everywhere. 
On Popcorn Watch you have access to data that is tailored to each selected movie or show. For example, using the search bad, you are able to search for any show or movie you can think of, and if its available through the API we implemented, you will be able to click the image and you will receive IMBD information about the movie or show. Each search response brings forward movie or show posters that make app much more visually appealing.  

#### Situation
 As a team, Deja and I wanted to create a project where we could implement themoviedb.org API. The API itself is an amazing database that has any information that you could think of. It has data on the top movies and shows and is constantly being updated. We thought creating an app that resembled Netflix would be a great way to utilize this API. We really love how on the Netflix app you are shown on the home screen a page full of movies and when you click the movie you are able to get summary info, etc. So it was something that we wanted to replicate within our app. Popcorn Watch app as it stands now, is a great resource for anybody that wants to search for the best movies and shows that are implemented in the moviedb.org API.
#### Task
 Deja and I had just completed the deployment app that we created using React and we thought that continuing on using React would help us establish a solid foundation of our skills. In order to make it a little bit easier on us, we implemented Bootstrap components to help us create a uniform look and feel. Bootstrap has some color limitations so we tried to choose the colors that reflected like Netflix. At the beginning of our project, we did a lot of peer programming to try to take advantage of the time that we were given on fridays. We decided to keep track of every task on the project board we created on Github and assigned tasks that way. We would meet again on Tuesdays for an half an hour to update each other on our individual tasks and to see how far we had gotten along. It was very important for us to be able to review each others code and set up our Github settings to not let one person merge without their code getting checked by the other person.
