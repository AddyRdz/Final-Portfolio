## Popcorn Watch
### Overview
Popcorn Watch is a React front end app that was created during our front end module by Deja Clarke and I. As a user you can search the top movies and shows and get more information regarding the selected movies. 

#### Situation
 - As a team, Deja and I wanted to create a project where we could implement themoviedb.org API. The API itself is an amazing database that has any information that you could think of. It has data on the top movies and shows and is constantly being updated. We thought creating an app that resembled Netflix would be a great way to utilize this API. We really love how on the Netflix app you are shown on the home screen a page full of movies and when you click the movie you are able to get summary info, etc. So it was something that we wanted to replicate within our app. Popcorn Watch app as it stands now, is a great resource for anybody that wants to search for the best movies and shows that are implemented in the moviedb.org API.
#### Task
- Deja and I had just completed the deployment app that we created using React and we thought that continuing on using React would help us establish a solid foundation of our skills. In order to make it a little bit easier on us, we implemented Bootstrap components to help us create a uniform look and feel. Bootstrap has some color limitations so we tried to choose the colors that reflected like Netflix. 
 - At the beginning of our project, we did a lot of peer programming to try to take advantage of the time that we were given on fridays. We decided to keep track of every task on the project board we created on Github and assigned tasks that way. We would meet again on Tuesdays for an half an hour to update each other on our individual tasks and to see how far we had gotten along. It was very important for us to be able to review each others code and set up our Github settings to not let one person merge without their code getting checked by the other person.

#### Action
- As a team, we each had different tasks that we were in charge of. I created a profile on the API website in order to be able to receive the API key. After Deja set up a basic react app, she went ahead and set the app up where you could fetch from the API. I realized that our API key was not protected so I changed our files and protected our API key. I also wanted to get more experience in setting up routes in react so I took the libery of setting up our home and shows page. This gave us the opportunity of havimg multiple pages in our app instead of just the home page. Our first nav bar did not have a search section but with the help of bootstrap I was able to implement a search section to our search bar. Deja and I collaborated on creating our logo and I added it to our navigation bar.
- For the most part we did not run into any serious issues until we started setting up a click module that we had where we could not see the details of our movie. I believe the source of our issue was in the css stylin and with the help of David we were able to solve the issue.


#### Result
On Popcorn Watch you are able to search the top movies and shows and receive more information.
