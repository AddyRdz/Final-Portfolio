## The Spoonful Blog
The Spoonful Blog is a full stack React app that allows users to create blog posts that contains food information. As a user you can posts recipes, blog posts, and pics about your favorite food. It doesn't really matter as long as it has to do with food!

#### Situation
As a team, Deja, Krystal, and I decided that we wanted to make a food focused blog that could show our culinary interests. We love visiting sites that have foods reviews and have vibrant pictures attached to them, and thought it would be great to create our own. On this project we were focused on deployment and we wanted to make sure to build something that would motivate us to create a full stack app. As foodies we always take pictures of our food but wanted to build The Spoonful Blog to have a place where anybody could post their favorite recipes, food ratings, and favorite food pics.
