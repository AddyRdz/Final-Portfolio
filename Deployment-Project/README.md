## The Spoonful Blog
The Spoonful Blog is a full stack React app that allows users to create blog posts that contains food information. As a user you can posts recipes, blog posts, and pics about your favorite food. It doesn't really matter as long as it has to do with food!

#### Situation
- As a team, Deja, Krystal, and I decided that we wanted to make a food focused blog that could show our culinary interests. We love visiting sites that have foods reviews and have vibrant pictures attached to them, and thought it would be great to create our own. On this project we were focused on deployment and we wanted to make sure to build something that would motivate us to create a full stack app. As foodies we always take pictures of our food but wanted to build The Spoonful Blog to have a place where anybody could post their favorite recipes, food ratings, and favorite food pics.

#### Task
- As a team we knew that our next module would be front end focused so we decided to create the front end of our app using `React` which would help us remember the rules of how everything worked. In order to be able to easily add elements we added bootstrap for our card and navigation components. Previously we all had experience in creating a CRUD app and we drew from that experience when creating this blog app.
- In order to complete this project we were able to pair program as we saw fit but we also assigned everyone assigned tasks. We meet twice weekly and mostly communicated through webex. As a group we felt it was very important to set rules on our Github repo to be able to avoid future conflicts. In order to merge any new code changes, your pull requests needed to be approved.
