## The Spoonful Blog
The Spoonful Blog is a full stack React app that allows users to create blog posts that contains food information. As a user you can posts recipes, blog posts, and pics about your favorite food. It doesn't really matter as long as it has to do with food!

#### Situation
- As a team, Deja, Krystal, and I decided that we wanted to make a food focused blog that could show our culinary interests. We love visiting sites that have foods reviews and have vibrant pictures attached to them, and thought it would be great to create our own. On this project we were focused on deployment and we wanted to make sure to build something that would motivate us to create a full stack app. As foodies we always take pictures of our food but wanted to build The Spoonful Blog to have a place where anybody could post their favorite recipes, food ratings, and favorite food pics.

#### Task
- As a team we knew that our next module would be front end focused so we decided to create the front end of our app using `React` which would help us remember the rules of how everything worked. In order to be able to easily add elements we added bootstrap for our card and navigation components. Previously we all had experience in creating a CRUD app and we drew from that experience when creating this blog app.
- In order to complete this project we were able to pair program as we saw fit but we also assigned everyone assigned tasks. We meet twice weekly and mostly communicated through webex. As a group we felt it was very important to set rules on our Github repo to be able to avoid future conflicts. In order to merge any new code changes, your pull requests needed to be approved.

#### Action
- At the time that I was working on this module I was working on a ticket for my team that included testing, so I decided I wanted to focus on creating a test for our blog. It ultimately was helpful because we included test action file in our Github actions. I also wrote the seed data that allowed us to have information on our blog as we were building it up. It was very helpful when were using Postman to reference our already created blog posts. I was also able to add the logo we created onto our navigation bar. It was able to help us tie in our logo into our app a bit more.
- I think one of the most underrated features from our blog app, is that you are able to upload picture links. It really brings the blog posts together when you have an image that is able to provide that extra brightness.
  
#### Result
- In the end we were able to come up with very important lessons, we struggled at the end to figure out our deployment. We were having a lot of errors when we were first trying to deploy our front and back end. But with the help of our Multiverse coaches we were able to resolve the issue and successfully deploy our app on Railway. It definitely made us aware to deploy sooner rather than later because you don't know what kind of problems you might run into.

## Competencies
### JF 5.2
- Understands how to test code and analyze results to correct errors found using unit testing
- After creating the unit test that was testing our seed data, there were times when changed some of our seed data and then we would get errors on the test I created. It was a nice reminder that if you are using seed data information in your unit test, and you change that information, then you will get errors and that might cause problems.
- It was a nice resource when debugging because I could go back and see what the test was having issues with. This skill was very helpful when debugging errors that I saw while I was trying to create my own code changes. 

### JF 5.4
- Understands and is able to identify and create test scenarios
- Given the lack of information we had when we were first creating our blog, we wanted to be able to have that extra requirement when deploying our app so we felt that implementing testing would be a good start. Obviously in order to be able to do that we needed a test situation we were aware that having seed data would fulfill that.
