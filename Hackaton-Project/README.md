## Movie Theater GO
Movie Theater Go is a CRUD app, functionality can be seen on Postman. The Movie Theater Go app is meant to be a library that holds a list of all your favorite movies.

#### Situation
- I really enjoying watching movies, and have always wanted something that could help me keep track of every movie that I have watched. After selecting GO as my hackaton language, I wanted to start to create a project that I would be passionate about and could finish in phases. This app has the potential to be used daily by movie lovers.

#### Task
- This app was mostly written in `Go` and and that database that was used was `ElephantSQL`, I did have a little bit of previous experience using it, so it was not completely new to me at the time. In order to test to make sure that I was able to create, edit, delete, update, I used `Postman`. I was much less familiar with `Gorm` and `Tableplus` and had to do more research on them.

#### Action
- In order to create this CRUD app, I took a Udemy course on Golang that went over the Golang basics, I had to take it a step further and look up youtube videos that had more detailed project information. I enjoyed working on my `controllers/post.go` page because it reminded me of when creating routes using Express. I was able to refer back to that experience and relate it to what I was doing now with Go.
- I did find the Udemy course that was offered to learn Go to be a little all over the place. Maybe if there was different course options I would've gained more of a deeper knowledge. I was able to overcome this finding outside resources such as Youtube.com and stackoverflow.

#### Result
- As a result I was able to create that back-end of Movie Theater Go and was able to test it using Postman to prove its capabilities. As a stretch goal I would've enjoyed creating the front-end of the app and it would be a worthy challenge considering I did not have much experience with Go front end.

## Competencies
### JF 2.1
- Can create and analyze artefacts, such as use cases and/or user stories
- When creating my goals for this app, I thought of what I wanted to be able to do as a user and I did that by writing down my goals as a user. For example, one of my main goals was, "As a user I will be able to create a movie". I am able to think as the user when deciding what I want to happen in my app. It is important to switch from your needs to the user needs because ultimately the user is who is using your app.

### JF 6.4
- Works independently and takes responsibility. For example, has a disciplined and responsible approach to risk, and stays motivated and committed when facing challenges
- As I was creating this project, I was having difficulty when trying to understand how I was going to show what I had learned up until that point. I was able to remember the ultimate goal of this module was to push yourself to create something in a language you were not comfortable with and embraced the challenge.
- I was able to switch my thinking and created movie theater go as something that I could show off to others that had no idea on how `Go` works. In the end I was extremely pleased with my results.
