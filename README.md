# Multiverse Final Portfolio

This repository is a collection of some of my key learnings during Sep 2022 - Dec 2023 apprenticeship at Cisco. Thru this experience I have been able to complete a front end project, back end project, deployment project, and a hackaton and hope to showcase them here.

## Portfolio Introduction
- My name is Addy Rodriguez and I have had the opportunity be part of the Multiverse Apprenticeship Program with Cisco since Sept 2022. I have been coding since 2021 and throughout different bootcamps and experiences I have gathered knowledge that has helped me pursue a career in technology. 
- I was inspired to pursue a career in tech because I have always had a passion for solving problems and learning and felt that tech would be able to provide that for me. 
- At Cisco I made sure to take advantage of many of the resources available to me. I took extra trainings that were not required of me and I joined many self development programs that needed time commitment. Through each experience I was able to gain excellent mentors that helped me navigate my journey.
  - Global Executive Shadow Program
  - Security Flight Trainings
  - AI Green Belt Badge
  - Udemy Courses
  - Pluralsight Courses
  - Leadership Development

- At Cisco I was part of the Security Business Group and worked in the SSX-Portal Interstellar team.
- I've recently developed an interest in AI topics and love learning of how I can utilize it to make me a better programmer. I try to stay aware of new upcoming techology and sharing my finds with others.

## Technical Projects
I was able to work on different projects that focused on a variety of technical skills. For example:
- Front-End: Popcorn Watch
- Back-End: Spongebob's Recipe Book
- Deployment: The Spoonful Blog
- Hackaton: Movie Go
Link projects.
